# Ratchet VERIFY — Quality Gate Verification

Run verification checks on concepts and their edges to ensure graph integrity.

## Invocation

```
/ratchet-verify [concept_id]        # verify specific concept
/ratchet-verify batch               # verify all recently modified concepts
/ratchet-verify --promoted          # verify all promoted-layer concepts
/ratchet-verify --full              # full graph integrity scan
```

## Verification Checks

### Per-Concept Checks

1. **Description Quality**
   - Non-empty, >10 chars
   - Fails if just the name repeated
   - Passes Disagreement Test (someone could argue against it)

2. **Edge Quality**
   - Every edge has an articulation reason
   - No self-loops
   - No duplicate edges (same source+target+relation)
   - Bidirectional edges explicitly justified

3. **Trust Zone Validity**
   - KERNEL: ≥3 supporting edges, verified by audit
   - REFINED: ≥1 supporting edge, description sharpened
   - INTAKE: newly extracted, awaiting connection
   - QUARANTINE: high-entropy source, not yet processed

4. **Source Provenance**
   - Has SOURCE_MAP edge to origin document
   - Source document path is valid

### Graph-Wide Checks

5. **Connectivity**
   - No orphan concepts in promoted layer (0 edges = FAIL)
   - Giant component contains >90% of promoted concepts

6. **Density**
   - Promoted layer: ratio ≥ 2.0 edges per node
   - Full graph: ratio ≥ 1.5 edges per node

7. **Balance**
   - No concept has >50 edges (hub explosion)
   - No trust zone has >80% of concepts (distribution issue)

8. **Contradiction Audit**
   - CONTRADICTS edges have evidence in both nodes
   - Contradictions don't span >2 hops without resolution

## Output Format

```yaml
verification:
  total_checked: N
  passed: N
  warnings: N
  failures: N
  checks:
    - id: description_quality
      status: pass|warn|fail
      detail: "..."
    - id: edge_quality
      status: pass|warn|fail
      detail: "..."
```

## Failure Actions

| Failure | Auto-Fix? | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Empty description | NO | Flag for REWEAVE |
| Missing source edge | YES | Add SOURCE_MAP if source_doc field exists |
| Orphan in promoted | NO | Flag for REFLECT |
| Hub explosion (>50) | NO | Flag for SPLIT consideration |
| Duplicate edge | YES | Remove duplicate, keep highest-weight |

## Pipeline

VERIFY is the final step of the 6R loop. After verification:
- Passing concepts can be promoted to higher trust zones
- Failing concepts cycle back to REDUCE/REFLECT/REWEAVE as needed
